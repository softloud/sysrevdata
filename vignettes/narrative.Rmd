## Constructing a narrative table

In contract to structuring data for machines, a narrative table is for summarising data to be interpreted by a human reader. 

This may involve engineering the data for the summary results required and filtering to results that can be displayed on a printed page. These decisions are informed by what information is most important to highlight from the dataset. 

However, in practical terms, our workflow will be informed by what structure of data we begin with. Here we consider a wide to narrative table.
