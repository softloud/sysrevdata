```{r pkg, message=FALSE}

# the tidyverse is a metapackage that loads a suite of tools

If not already installed, run `install.packages("package name")` in the console before beginning.

Let's get some data to work with.


```{bash}
# data we want are in data-raw
ls data-raw/

```
<aside>
This data comes from 

> todo

</aside>



```{r}

# import data
example_dat <- 
  read_csv("data-raw/Haddawayetal2018bufferstrips.csv")

```

Inspecting large datasets can slow your machine down, so best to check dimensions before beginning to work with data.

```{r}
dim_dat <- 
  example_dat %>% 
  dim()
```

With `r dim_dat[1]` rows and `r dim_dat[2]` columns, this is not so big that we can't inspect it. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
example_dat %>% 
  View()
```
